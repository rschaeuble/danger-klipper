# Configuration reference

## ⚠️ Danger Options

### [danger_options]

A collection of DangerKlipper-specific system options

```
[danger_options]
#error_on_unused_config_options: True
#   If an unused config option or section should cause an error
#   if False, will warn but allow klipper to still run.
#   The default is True.
#allow_plugin_override: False
#   Allows modules in `plugins` to override modules of the same name in `extras`
#   The default is False.
#multi_mcu_trsync_timeout: 0.025
#   The timeout (in seconds) for MCU synchronization during the homing process when
#   multiple MCUs are in use. The default is 0.025
#homing_elapsed_distance_tolerance: 0.5
#   Tolerance (in mm) for distance moved in the second homing. Ensures the
#   second homing distance closely matches the `min_home_dist` when using
#   sensorless homing. The default is 0.5mm.
#temp_ignore_limits: False
#   When set to true, this parameter ignores the min_value and max_value
#   limits for temperature sensors. It prevents shutdowns due to
#   'ADC out of range' and similar errors by allowing readings outside the
#   specified range without triggering a shutdown. The default is False.
#autosave_includes: False
#   When set to true, SAVE_CONFIG will recursively read [include ...] blocks
#   for conflicts to autosave data. Any configurations updated will be backed
#   up to configs/config_backups.
#bgflush_extra_time: 0.250
#   This allows to set extra flush time (in seconds). Under certain conditions,
#   a low value will result in an error if message is not get flushed, a high value
#   (0.250) will result in homing/probing latency. The default is 0.250

# Logging options

#minimal_logging: False
#   Set all log parameters log options to False. The default is False.
#log_statistics: True
#   If statistics should be logged
#   (helpful for keeping the log clean during development)
#   The default is True.
#log_config_file_at_startup: True
#   If the config file should be logged at startup
#   The default is True.
#log_bed_mesh_at_startup: True
#   If the bed mesh should be logged at startup
#   (helpful for keeping the log clean during development)
#   The default is True.
#log_shutdown_info: True
#   If we should log detailed crash info when an exception occurs
#   Most of it is overly-verbose and fluff and we still get a stack trace
#   for normal exceptions, so setting to False can help save time while developing
#   The default is True.
#log_serial_reader_warnings: True
#log_startup_info: True
#log_webhook_method_register_messages: False
```
