### [board_pins]

Board pin aliases (one may define any number of sections with a
"board_pins" prefix). Use this to define aliases for the pins on a
micro-controller.

```
[board_pins my_aliases]
mcu: mcu
#   A comma separated list of micro-controllers that may use the
#   aliases. The default is to apply the aliases to the main "mcu".
aliases:
aliases_<name>:
#   A comma separated list of "name=value" aliases to create for the
#   given micro-controller. For example, "EXP1_1=PE6" would create an
#   "EXP1_1" alias for the "PE6" pin. However, if "value" is enclosed
#   in "<>" then "name" is created as a reserved pin (for example,
#   "EXP1_9=<GND>" would reserve "EXP1_9"). Any number of options
#   starting with "aliases_" may be specified.
```
