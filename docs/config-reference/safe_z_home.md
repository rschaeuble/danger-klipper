## Customized homing

### [safe_z_home]

Safe Z homing. One may use this mechanism to home the Z axis at a
specific X, Y coordinate. This is useful if the toolhead, for example
has to move to the center of the bed before Z can be homed.

```
[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position:
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100, 100) where the Z homing should be
#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50.0
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home
#   coordinate. The default is 50 mm/s
#z_hop:
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is
#   applied to any homing command, even if it doesn't home the Z axis.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than z_hop, then this will lift the head to a height of z_hop. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by z_hop.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
#z_hop_speed: 15.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The
#   default is 15 mm/s.
#move_to_previous: False
#   When set to True, the X and Y axes are reset to their previous
#   positions after Z axis homing. The default is False.
